# Sharding-in-MongoDB

This blog helps you to do **SHARDING in mongodb via mongo Shell as well as programmatically in node .js .**
Sharding means dividing/splitting the database over a single machine and distributing it across several machines to meet the increaing data growth. This process increases the throughput of the application as well as can support deployment of very large data-sets.
For more information on Sharding, please refer to the official <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/">MonogoDB docs.</a>
